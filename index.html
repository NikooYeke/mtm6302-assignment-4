    <h1>ICE CREAM</h1>
<p>Ice cream is typically known as the most popular frozen treat. To be qualified as ice cream, the frozen mixture must be made with no less than 10% milkfat, sometimes referred to as butterfat. It can also me no more than 100% overrun.

    This means that the base can’t increase in volume by over 100% in the churning process. If it does, this results in a mixture that is over 50% air.
    
    As you already know, staring at the frozen section of your local grocery store, there endless variations of ice cream</p>

    <h3>MOCHI ICE CREAM</h3>
    <p>Of course, Mochi Ice Cream is our favorite. We take premium ice cream and wrap it in delicious, authentic Mochi dough, allowing you to ditch the spoon and take your ice cream with you wherever you go.</p>

  <h3>GELATO</h3>
  <p>Gelato, Ice Cream’s Italian cousin, is made with whole milk, without using added cream. This makes the milkfat percentage much lower than traditional ice cream. Also, gelato is often made without eggs and stabilizers. While it is being churned, there is little to no air whipped into it, leaving a dense, thick texture.</p>
